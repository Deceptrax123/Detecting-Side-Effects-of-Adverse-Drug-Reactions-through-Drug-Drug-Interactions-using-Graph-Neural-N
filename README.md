# Modelling Drug-Target Interaction to predict side effects using Graph Neural Networks

## About
We create graph neural networks of various operations such as attention, graph convolution, SAGE etc including self-supervised pretraining of models to predict side effects of a drug and target protein interaction and achieve state of the art results on various performance metrics.
